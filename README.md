# Image-Processing-with-3D-Convolution
In my image processing project, I implemented 3D convolution operations using C++ and OpenCV. I developed functions for blurring, edge detection, and feature extraction on 3D grayscale images, managing borders with zero-padding. This project enhanced my skills in advanced image processing techniques and modular programming.
